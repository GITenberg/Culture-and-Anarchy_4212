description: "Culture and Anarchy is a series of periodical essays by Matthew Arnold,\
  \ first published in Cornhill Magazine 1867-68 and collected as a book in 1869.\
  \ The preface was added in 1875.\nArnold's famous piece of writing on culture established\
  \ his High Victorian cultural agenda which remained dominant in debate from the\
  \ 1860s until the 1950s.\nAccording to his view advanced in the book, \"Culture\
  \ [...] is a study of perfection\". He further wrote that: \"[Culture] seeks to\
  \ do away with classes; to make the best that has been thought and known in the\
  \ world current everywhere; to make all men live in an atmosphere of sweetness and\
  \ light [...]\".\nHis often quoted phrase \"[culture is] the best which has been\
  \ thought and said\" comes from the Preface to Culture and Anarchy:\nThe whole scope\
  \ of the essay is to recommend culture as the great help out of our present difficulties;\
  \ culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on\
  \ all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said\
  \ in the world, and, through this knowledge, turning a stream of fresh and free\
  \ thought upon our stock notions and habits, which we now follow staunchly but mechanically,\
  \ vainly imagining that there is a virtue in following them staunchly which makes\
  \ up for the mischief of following them mechanically.\nThe book contains most of\
  \ the terms - culture, sweetness and light, Barbarian, Philistine, Hebraism, and\
  \ many others - which are more associated with Arnold's work influence.\n^ Robert\
